The logic of Quiz Game with Python
The Quiz game asks the player questions about animals.
 They have three chances to answer each question you don’t want to take the quiz too difficult. Each correct answer will score a point. 
At the end of the game, the program will reveal the player’s final score.

This quiz game uses a function; a block of code with a name that performs a specific task. 
A function allows you to use the same code several times, without having to type everything each time. 
Python has a lot of built-in functions, but it also allows you to create your functions.

The program should continue to check if there are any questions to ask and if the player has exhausted all his chances.
 The score is stored in a variable during the game. Once all the questions have been answered, the game ends.
Summary
Mix up your quiz! Make it longer or harder, use different types of questions, or even change the subject of the quiz.
 You can try some or all of these hacks and tweaks, but remember to save them as a separate Python file so you don’t mess up the original game.
